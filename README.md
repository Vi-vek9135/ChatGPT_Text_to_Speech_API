**README: Text-to-Speech Using OpenAI's GPT-3 API**

**Introduction:**
This Python script demonstrates how to utilize OpenAI's GPT-3 API for text-to-speech synthesis. It generates an audio file from a provided text using the GPT-3 TTS (Text-to-Speech) model. The generated speech is saved to a file named "speech.mp3."

**Dependencies:**
- openai: Python library for interacting with the OpenAI GPT-3 API.
- cohere: A library for simplifying access to OpenAI API results.
- tiktoken: A library for counting tokens in a text string without making an API call.
- An OpenAI API key is required. The key should be set as the value of the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable.

**Setup:**
1. Install the required dependencies using:
   ```
   pip install openai cohere tiktoken
   ```
2. Obtain an API key from OpenAI by signing up at [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/signup/).
3. Set your OpenAI API key by replacing the placeholder in the script:
   ```python
   OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
   ```

**Usage:**
1. Run the notebook.
2. The notebook initializes OpenAI's GPT-3 API client with the provided API key.
3. It sends a request to the GPT-3 TTS model with specified parameters, including the model name, voice, and input text.
4. The generated audio stream is saved to the "speech.mp3" file in the current directory.

**Important Notes:**
- Ensure that your OpenAI API key is valid and has the necessary permissions to access the GPT-3 TTS model.
- The provided input text in the script is an example; you can modify it according to your requirements.
- The script uses the "tts-1" model and the "alloy" voice; you can explore other options based on the OpenAI API documentation.
- The generated speech file is saved as "speech.mp3" in the current working directory. You can customize the `speech_file_path` variable to change the output file location.

**Additional Information:**
- Refer to the official OpenAI API documentation for more details on available models, voices, and parameters.
- For information on cohere and tiktoken, refer to their respective documentation.
